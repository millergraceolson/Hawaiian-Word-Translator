# Overview:
Welcome to the Hawaiian Word Translator, a unique tool designed to bridge the gap between the Hawaiian language and its pronunciation. Phonetic pronunciation guides can help make languages we are unfarmiliar with more accessible to us. In this project, the program aims to produce phonetic pronunciations for Hawaiian words.

# How it works: 
1. Input: users input a Hawaiian word into the program.
2. Translation: The rogram processes the input and translates it into its phonetic pronunciation.
3. Output: users receive the written pronunciation.

# Language: 
C++
